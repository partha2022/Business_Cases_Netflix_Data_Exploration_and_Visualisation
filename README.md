You can watch the lecture recordings or go through your lecture notes once again if you feel like you’re getting confused over some specific topics.
Discuss your problems with your peers. Make use of the Slack channel and WhatsApp group.
Only if you think that there’s a major issue, you can reach out to your Instructor via Slack or Email.
